1. Your program shall ask how many languages user wants to input and then ask information of the
language (language name, ISO 639-1 code, language family and number of people who speaks the
language).
2. Your program shall dynamically allocate memory for correct amount of structs
3. Your program shall have void addLanguage(/*parameters here*/) function (with necessary
parameters): function adds the information asked from user to correct members of a struct
4. Your program shall have void printLanguages(/*parameters here*/) function (with necessary
parameters): function prints out all added languages
5. Otherwise use common sense how you divide your code into functions
6. After adding all languages, the list of languages shall be printed out. 
7. Please have the necessary error checking so that user cannot leave language name empty. Print a
descriptive error message if user leaves language name empty, ask the name again until it is
inputted and then move on to the rest of the information normally.
